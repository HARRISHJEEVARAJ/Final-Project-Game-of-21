The Game :  This game is a simulation of the card game Black Jack using a standard deck of cards. In this game, the player will be playing against the computer. The game consists of multiple hands. The winner of each hand is determined based on the following rules:  Rule: The winner of a hand is the player to get closest to a point total of 21 without exceeding 21. If the player gets 21, they win the game. If a playerâ€™s card total is 22 or higher they lose that hand. If the player can draw 5 cards and stay below 21, they win the hand.  In this card, game points are awarded based on the cards dealt. The following is the point value for individual cards: 1. Face cards (King, Queen &amp; Jack) have a value of 10 points 2. Numbered cards (2 through 10) have a point value equal to the card number 3. The ace can have a value of 1 or 11. The Computer should never draw another card once its point total meets or exceeds 18. The Computer also loses if its point total exceeds 21.
